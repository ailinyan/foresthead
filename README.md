Hi! My name is Alena, I am a senior year university student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

I'm interested in Deep Learning (since my thesis topic is related to this) and software development. Currently, I'm learning more about deep learning computer vision models.
I'm planning to add here my little projects.
